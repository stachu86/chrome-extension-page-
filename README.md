# chrome-extension-page-pp
This is simple chrome extension that allows to navigate with keyboard on pages like:

www.example.com/gallery/<number>.JPG
www.example.com/news/very-funny-kittens-<number>.html
www.example.com/?pageId=<number>

With keyboard shortcuts:
Ctrl - Left arrorw (decrementing <number>)
Ctrl - Right arrorw (incrementing <number>)

This extension is very simple! It will not chceck if the file exist, there is no handling of trailing 0's mix of numbers and text in the file name.
